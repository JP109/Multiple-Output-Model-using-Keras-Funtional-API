# Multiple-Output-Model-using-Keras-Funtional-API
This model was created to practise writing multi-output models using the functional API of Tensprflow 2.0. It uses the energy efficiency dataset that which uses the bulding features (e.g. wall area, roof area) as inputs and has two outputs: Cooling Load and Heating Load.
